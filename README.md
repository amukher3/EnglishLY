A simple effort to categorise POS tags in english language texts from PDFs

Following is an effort to extract and label `_parts of speech_ ` tags in english language texts from PDF copies. This project uses 
Spacy to extract and label the various `_parts of speech_` tags in the text. This project also tries to find out the phrases like 
`_noun phrases_` and `_verb phrases_` in english language text. 

Commit details are in my _Bit-Bucket_ account.
